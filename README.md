# Stabilisation Platform
This code has been implemented on the Arduino Uno Rev 3 embedded system (part of my bachelor's thesis).

## Description
This project demonstrates the efficient implementation of a sensor fusion algorithm, computing data from both accelerometer and gyroscope in order to deliver a reliable solution for our application.

## Getting Started
To use this project, follow these steps:

1. **Check Out the Electrical Diagram**: There you will find all the components that are needed for this project.

2. **Design and Print a Housing of Your Taste**: Check out the housing pictures in the repository for housing ideas.

3. **Mount and Wire the Components According to the Electrical Diagram**: Follow the electrical diagram and wire accordingly.

4. **Upload the Provided Code**: Upload the code via ArduinoIDE.

5. **Fine Tuning**: Take into account that some variable values have to be determined experimentally. Please proceed with great attention to details before the final assembly of the platform.
   
6. **Testing and Concluding**: After you have concluded all the necessary tests and you are satisfied with the results, you can close the housing and conclude.

**!!! IMPORTANT NOTICE !!!** 
1. **Please** take all the safety precautions when working with electrical circuits and components! Do not engage in working with live wires! It is recommended that your house should be equipped with the RCBO (Europe) or GFCI (USA) type safety switches.
   
2. **Please** wear safety glasses while using power tools.
   
3. I am not responsible for any injuries or damages!
